&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Office of Teaching Centers (OTC)</b> was established on 1st of August, 2009. There are four centers under the OTC, including three teaching units: General Education Center, Language Center, and Office of Physical Education, and the only administrative unit is Art Center.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Office of Teaching Centers (OTC) was officially established, Teaching Center Planning Commission was held first, under Article 39 of the NCU organizational regulations, commission convened by head of the Academic Affairs, for developing all teaching centers on campus. Shortly after, Teaching Center Committee was organized on 1st of August, 2005, following the suggestions of the University General Education Evaluation Pilot Plan, under the guidance of the Ministry of Education, to promote the integration of teaching in seven research universities. NCU was the first to propose the title of Teaching Center Committee. General Education Curriculum was used in similar organizations at NTU and NTHU.
        <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the University General Education Evaluation Committee meeting, Teaching Center Committee was reformed in 2009 as the Office of Teaching Centers (OTC), in order to strengthen its administration functions. The main responsibility of the OTC is to find the core values of higher education in university education besides vocational education. More importantly, the OTC is responsible for administering the above mentioned centers. Important duties include establishing Teacher Review Committee and Curriculum Committee.
