&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop all of teaching center, Teaching Center Planning Commission was established in accordance with the NCU organizational regulations Article 39, commission convened by provost.
        <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to University General Education Evaluation Pilot Program, the guidance of Ministry of Education for seven research universities, Teaching Center Committee was established in 2005 to promote the integration of teaching.
        <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Teaching Center Committee was first proposed by NCU, similar organizations in NTU and NTHU named General Education Curriculum.
        <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the University General Education evaluation committee meeting in 2007, to enhance the actual functions, Teaching Center Committee was reformed as Office of Teaching Center (OTC).
        <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven affiliates of OTC, including four teaching units and three administrative units. Teaching units are General Education Center, Teacher Education Center, Language Center, Office of Physical Education.
        <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major responsibility of OTC is trying to find the necessary connotation of education in university education holistically besides professional education. So, OTC is an important office for university education besides other departments. In addition to the development of the above, OTC is responsible for several administrations (establishing Teacher Review Committee and Curriculum Committee …etc.) for education center of the above. We have one center director for administering all committee and one office assistant for dealing with all general affairs.
